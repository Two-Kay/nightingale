### Directory structure

```
packages/my-component/package.json # contains the package definition
                      src/index.js # import your main component and register it as a custom element
                      src/my-component.js # definition of your main component
                      test # your test definitions
```

### Naming conventions

- Your package name should be short and descriptive (avoid acronyms).
- If your component is for ProtVista (the protein features visualisation tool) it should have the `protvista-` prefix.
- the file in which your main component is defined should have the same name as your package (in kebab-case).
- your main component should have the same name as your package, but in PascalCase.
- Documentation, comments, and more importantly code, should all use American English. For example, use `color` and not ~`colour`~
